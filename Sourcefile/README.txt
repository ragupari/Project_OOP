Our Mystic Mayhem game will create a new 'username'.txt file for each player inside 'Players' folder.
Also will create a record in 'players.csv' file for each existing and new player.

At the begining of the game, it will create a few default players.
    1. GeraltofRivia with usename 'whitewolf'
    2. Parishith with usename 'pari'
    3. Kajaluxan with usename 'kajali'
    4. Sukithan with usename 'Suki'
    5. Vithusanaa with usename 'Vithu'

You can create a new player or can login to an existing player using the appropriate username.
(Note that the usernames are case-sensitive)

In the welcome page, you can access all the informations such as,
    1. Show my army
    2. Buy army
    3. Buy equipment
    4. Sell army
    5. Set my homeground
    6. Show other players (You can declare war with other players here)
    7. Go to War

To check the functionality of our game under '6. Show other players (You can declare war with other players here)',
you can see the other players stats. These will be randomly shown.
You can declare war with other players in this section.
But even if you declared the war, the other player must accept it to see the battle results.

For the sake of checking the functionality, declare war to a player from '6. Show other players (You can declare war with other players here)' section,
and then login as that other player and under '7. Go to war' section accept the war invitation. 
Then the battle results will be shown.

Before going to battle, buy atleast one character from each army category.

(Note that if you choose other than the given options, in somecases it might cause errors)
